## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of our software products very seriously. If you have found any issues related to security, please send an email to us instead of using the issue tracker.

📧 Email: security@example.com

We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings, and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

## Expectations

When you report a vulnerability, we expect that:

- You will provide details of the vulnerability, including information needed to reproduce and validate the vulnerability and a Proof of Concept (PoC)
- You will not violate the privacy of other users, destroy data, or interrupt our services.

Thank you for helping keep our users safe!
